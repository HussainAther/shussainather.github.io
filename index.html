      <p> I am a Post-baccalaureate researcher at the National Institutes of Health where I work under Harold Burgess and Sinisa Pajevic. </p>
      <p> I studied physics and philosophy at Indiana University-Bloomington, and in the future I hope to enter a PhD program in bioinformatics or computational neuroscience. My projects can be found on my GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/hussainather">https://github.com/hussainather</a>).</p>
